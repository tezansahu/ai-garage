    "# Fine-tuning Phi-4 for Medical Reasoning: From Traditional to Reasoning SLM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to transform Microsoft's Phi-4, a traditional small language model (SLM), into a reasoning-capable model for medical applications. We'll use the `unsloth` library to efficiently fine-tune the model on the `o1-medical-reasoning` dataset, teaching it to \"think\" through medical problems step-by-step before providing answers.\n",

    "### What are Small Language Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Small Language Models (SLMs) are compact versions of large language models, typically containing **1-15 billion parameters** compared to the **100+ billion parameters** found in models like GPT-4 or Claude. Despite their smaller size, they offer several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Advantages of SLMs:**\n",
    "- üöÄ **Speed**: Faster inference times due to fewer parameters\n",
    "- üíæ **Memory Efficiency**: Lower VRAM requirements (can run on consumer GPUs)\n",
    "- ‚ö° **Cost-Effective**: Cheaper to train and deploy\n",
    "- üéØ **Task-Specific**: Can be highly optimized for specific domains\n",
    "- üè† **On-Device Deployment**: Can run locally without internet connectivity\n",

    "- **14 billion parameters**\n",
    "- **BF16 precision** (~25GB when fully loaded)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Traditional (Non-Reasoning) Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Most language models, including the base Phi-4, are **non-reasoning models**. They:\n",
    "- Generate responses **immediately** based on patterns learned during training\n",
    "- **Don't show their work** or explain their thought process\n",
    "- Can make mistakes due to **lack of deliberation**\n",

    "### Reasoning Models (Like OpenAI's o1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning models introduce a **\"thinking\" phase** before responding:\n",
    "- **Chain-of-Thought**: Step-by-step problem breakdown\n",
    "- **Self-reflection**: Ability to reconsider and correct reasoning\n",
    "- **Explicit reasoning**: Show intermediate steps\n",

    "\n",
    "- What drug is known to reduce alcohol cravings and decrease the likelihood of resumed heavy drinking in alcoholics after completing a detoxification program?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A 21-year-old college student faints while giving a presentation in class. Friends say he looked pale and sweaty before collapsing. He regained consciousness within a minute and felt weak but alert. He denies chest pain but recalls skipping breakfast that morning. He drinks a lot of energy drinks during exams and recently started going to the gym. His ECG shows a fast irregular heartbeat. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A 29-year-old startup founder had a bad flu two weeks ago. Now he has sharp chest pain that worsens when lying flat or taking deep breaths, but eases when sitting up and leaning forward. He gets worried it might be a heart attack. On exam, there‚Äôs a scratchy sound over the chest. ECG shows diffuse ST elevation and PR depression. What is the most likely diagnosis? What is the first-line treatment?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A 52-year-old IT manager comes for a routine check-up. He feels fine but says he often gets mild headaches after long workdays and sometimes feels ‚Äúpressure‚Äù in his head when climbing stairs. He has a BMI 31. On examination, his blood pressure is 168/102 mmHg. Fundoscopy shows early retinal changes, but his kidney function is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n",
