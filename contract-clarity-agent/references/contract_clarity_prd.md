---

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Information Asymmetry**: Individuals lack legal expertise to evaluate contracts they're asked to sign (employment agreements, vendor contracts, leases, NDAs, SaaS terms)
2. **Cost Barrier**: Legal review costs $300-500/hour, making it prohibitive for routine documents
3. **Complexity Overload**: 50+ page compliance documents and dense legal language create decision paralysis
4. **Hidden Risks**: Non-standard or unfavorable clauses (auto-renewal, broad IP assignment, liability caps) go unnoticed
5. **Lack of Context**: Users don't know what's "normal" vs. concerning for their situation

### User Impact
- Signing unfavorable terms unknowingly
- Missing negotiation opportunities
- Wasting hours trying to decipher legal language
- Anxiety and uncertainty about commitments being made

---

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. Enable users to understand 90%+ of key contract provisions within 5 minutes
2. Identify and flag high-risk or non-standard clauses with 85%+ accuracy
3. Provide actionable next steps for ambiguous or concerning terms
4. Deliver explanations at an 8th-grade reading level without losing accuracy

### Success Metrics
- **User Satisfaction**: 4+ star rating on clarity and usefulness
- **Time Savings**: Reduce document review time by 70% vs. manual reading
- **Engagement**: 60%+ of users ask follow-up questions

## Core Use Cases

### UC1: Contract Risk Assessment
**User Story**: As an individual, I want to upload a vendor agreement and understand what risks or unfavorable terms it contains, so I can decide whether to sign or negotiate.

**Flow**:
1. User uploads PDF/DOCX/image of contract
2. System extracts and analyzes document
3. System provides:
   - 3-5 sentence executive summary
   - Risk-tiered clause breakdown (High/Medium/Low concern)
   - Plain-language explanation of each flagged item
   - Suggestions for clarification or negotiation

**Example Output**:
```
ðŸ”´ HIGH CONCERN
Clause 7.3 (Liability Cap): You're limited to recovering only $500 in damages, 
even if their mistake costs you thousands. This is unusually low for a $10K annual contract.
â†’ Suggest: Ask them to raise the cap to at least the annual contract value.

ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM CONCERN  
Clause 4.2 (Auto-Renewal): Contract automatically renews yearly unless you cancel 
60 days in advance. Missing the deadline means another full year.
â†’ Suggest: Set a calendar reminder for 75 days before renewal date.
```

### UC2: Policy Translation
**User Story**: As an employee, I want to understand a 50-page compliance policy in plain English, so I know what actually applies to my daily work.

**Flow**:
1. User uploads policy document
2. User optionally specifies role/context ("I'm in engineering")
3. System provides:
   - Role-specific summary of relevant sections
   - Key do's and don'ts in bullet points
   - Explanation of consequences for violations
   - Links to specific sections for reference

### UC3: Clause Clarification
**User Story**: As a reader, I want to ask questions about specific confusing clauses, so I understand exactly what I'm agreeing to.

**Flow**:
1. User asks: "What does 'indemnification' mean in Section 9?"
2. System:
   - Locates relevant clause
   - Explains in plain language with real-world example
   - Notes if wording is ambiguous
   - Suggests clarifying questions to ask the other party

### UC4: Comparative Analysis
**User Story**: As a business owner, I want to know if this contract's terms are normal for my industry, so I can negotiate confidently.

**Flow**:
1. User uploads contract and specifies context (industry, contract type)
2. System provides:
   - Flags for terms that deviate from industry standards
   - Context on whether deviation is favorable/unfavorable
   - Data points: "Typical payment terms are Net-30; this requests Net-60"

---

## User Experience Flow

### Happy Path
1. **Landing**: User sees simple interface with upload area and example use cases
2. **Upload**: User drags PDF or pastes document text/image
3. **Processing**: "Analyzing your document..." (15-30s with progress indicator)
4. **Summary**: 
   - Executive summary at top
   - Risk flags below, organized by severity
   - Option to "Ask a question" at bottom
5. **Conversation**: User asks follow-up questions; agent responds with context
6. **Action**: User downloads summary or copies specific sections

### Error Handling
- Unreadable document: "This file appears corrupted. Try uploading as PDF or image."
- Unsupported type: "Currently, I can only analyze contracts, agreements, and policies. This appears to be [detected type]."
- Ambiguous query: "I found 3 sections about payment terms. Which one are you asking about?"

## Appendix B: Plain Language Examples

**Original**: "Vendor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Client from any claims arising from Vendor's negligent acts or omissions."

**Plain Language**: "If the vendor makes a mistake or doesn't do something they should have, they'll pay for any resulting lawsuits against you, including legal fees."

**Original**: "This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon 30 days' prior written notice."

**Plain Language**: "Either side can end this contract by giving the other side written notice 30 days in advance."

---

## Appendix C: Conversation Examples

**User**: "I got a job offer. Can you review the contract?"  
**Agent**: "I'd be happy to help! Please upload the offer letter or employment agreement, and I'll analyze it for you."

[After upload]

**Agent**: 
"I've reviewed your employment agreement. Here's what stands out:

**Summary**: This is a standard at-will employment offer with a few notable provisions around IP and non-compete.

ðŸ”´ **HIGH CONCERN**
**IP Assignment (Section 5)**: You're assigning 'all inventions and creative works' made during employment, even those created on your own time with your own resources. This is broader than typical.  
â†’ **Ask**: Can we limit this to work related to the company's business or created using company resources?

ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM CONCERN**  
**Non-Compete (Section 8)**: 12-month, 50-mile radius restriction after leaving. This is enforceable in [state] but may limit your next job.  
â†’ **Consider**: Negotiating down to 6 months or narrowing the scope to direct competitors only.

ðŸŸ¢ **Standard Terms**  
âœ“ Salary and benefits are clearly defined  
âœ“ Standard at-will employment (either side can terminate)  
âœ“ Reasonable confidentiality terms

**Questions?** I can explain any section in detail."

**User**: "What exactly does 'at-will' mean?"  
**Agent**: "'At-will employment' means either you or the company can end the employment relationship at any time, for any legal reason, without advance notice. Think of it like a month-to-month apartment leaseâ€”no long-term commitment required from either side. The company doesn't need to give a reason to let you go, and you don't need to give a reason to quit (though 2 weeks' notice is professional courtesy)."
