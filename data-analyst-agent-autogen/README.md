    <summary>How to generate a GitHub PAT?</summary>

    We'll use **Github Models Marketplace** to get free access to Large Language Models (LLMs) that will be used to create AI Agents.

    To access this service, you will need to create a **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**.

    This can be done by going to your [Personal Access Tokens settings](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) in your GitHub Account.

    Select the `Fine-grained tokens` option on the left side of your screen.

    Then select `Generate new token`.

    Add a **Token Name** & within **Permissions**, select `Read-only` access for **Models**. Then click `Generate token`.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository & get into the project directory
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tezansahu/ai-garage.git
    cd ai-garage/data-analyst-agent-autogen
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment using `uv`:
    ```sh
    uv venv
    # On Windows
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    uv sync
    ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Upload your dataset (CSV/TSV) using the sidebar
3. Add your GitHub PAT & select the LLM you wish to use
3. Ask questions about your data in natural language
4. View generated visualizations and insights
5. Use "New Chat" to start fresh analysis
