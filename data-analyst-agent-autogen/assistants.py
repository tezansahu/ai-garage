    """
    A specialized assistant agent that tracks and displays responses on Streamlit 
    while processing messages. This class extends the functionality of the 
    `AssistantAgent` by adding methods to handle and visualize responses, including 
    tool call requests, text messages, and responses containing image references.
    Methods:
        on_messages_stream(messages, cancellation_token):
            Asynchronously processes a stream of messages, tracks responses on 
            Streamlit, and yields each message (modified or unmodified).
        _track_response_on_streamlit(msg):
            Tracks and displays the response on Streamlit based on the type of 
            message (e.g., tool call requests, text messages, or responses).
        _handle_text_message(msg):
            Handles text messages by formatting the content, appending it to 
            Streamlit's session state, and displaying it in the chat interface. 
            Also processes image references if the message is from the 
            "DataAnalystAgent".
        _image_files_in_response(response):
            Extracts image file paths from a response string using regex matching. 
            Assumes image file paths are in the format '<file_name>.png'.

    Creates and returns a RoundRobinGroupChat instance consisting of a data analyst agent

    create visualizations, and execute Python code.
    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Loads environment variables using `load_dotenv`.
    2. Initializes an AzureAIChatCompletionClient with the specified model, endpoint, and credentials.
    3. Creates a PythonCodeExecutionTool for executing Python code in a local command-line environment.
    4. Configures a `TrackableAssistantAgent` for data analysis (`DataAnalystAgent`) with detailed 
       system instructions for analyzing datasets, generating visualizations, and creating reports.
    5. Configures a `TrackableAssistantAgent` for code execution (`CodeExecutorAgent`) with system 
       instructions for executing Python code and handling errors.
    6. Sets up a termination condition based on either a specific keyword ("TERMINATE") or a maximum 
       number of messages (15).
    7. Combines the agents into a `RoundRobinGroupChat` to enable collaborative interaction.
    Returns:
        RoundRobinGroupChat: A group chat instance with the data analyst agent and code executor agent, 
        along with the defined termination conditions.

        - Your first message must be a detailed plan of the steps you will take to analyze the data & address the user's query
        - You must write **correct** & **optimized** Python code to analyze data, extract insights, create visualizations and generate reports
        - Always start your code with all required `import` statements regardless of previous context
        - Always write complete code (NOT just incremental snippets) while iterating on the code
        - Initially, famialiarize yourself with the dataset, its structure & columns 
        - You must visualize the data most appropriatly using the best libraries available
        - Ensure that your visualizations are clear, informative and visually appealing, and **do NOT have any clutter**
        - If you generate any visualizations, you must save them to the local disk strictly in PNG format
        - Given any user query, your first stp must be to plan the steps to be taken to analyze the data
        - In the final response, you must explain the results of your analysis and visualizations in a clear and concise manner
        - Always mention the file names of the generated image files in your response
        - Do **NOT** summarize th findings until you have rceived feedback about correct execution of the code
        - You must end with the word 'TERMINATE' only at the end of your final response, once you are done with your analysis. **Do NOT use the word 'TERMINATE' if you have NOT received any feedback regarding the code execution.**
