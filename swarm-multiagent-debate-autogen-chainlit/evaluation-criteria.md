# Evaluation Criteria

To consistently evaluate the arguments presented, we will use the following criteria:
- **Relevance and Completeness:** How well do the arguments address the topic and cover different aspects of the issue?
- **Evidence and Examples:** How well are the arguments supported with empirical evidence, case studies, and examples?
- **Logical Coherence:** Are the arguments logically structured and free from fallacies?
- **Counterargument Addressal:** How effectively does the argument address potential counterarguments or opposing viewpoints?
- **Practical Feasibility:** Are the solutions proposed practical and implementable?

## Scoring Rubric
Each argument will be evaluated on a scale of 1-5 for each criterion:
1- Poor: The argument fails to meet the criterion.
2- Fair: The argument addresses the criterion but incompletely or ineffectively.
3- Good: The argument adequately meets the criterion.
4- Very Good: The argument meets the criterion with minor shortcomings.
5- Excellent: The argument fully satisfies the criterion.
