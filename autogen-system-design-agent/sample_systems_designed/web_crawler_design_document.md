## Functional Requirements

1. **Target Websites or Domains:** The web crawler should be configured to target specific websites or domains as specified by the user. An option to crawl any site on the internet should also be available for more general use cases.

2. **Handling Different Content Types:** The web crawler must be able to handle various types of content, including images, videos, and documents (PDFs, Word files, etc.). It should have the capability to download and store these contents or extract relevant metadata as specified by the configuration.

3. **Dynamic Content:** For dynamic content generated by JavaScript, the web crawler should be equipped with a headless browser or a similar technology to accurately render and extract such content. This ensures that all information on the page can be captured.

4. **Revisit Frequency:** The web crawler should revisit the same websites at configurable intervals. This could be set to daily, weekly, or according to the user's specific needs and the nature of the website's content updates.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance and Speed:** The web crawler should prioritize a balance between speed and comprehensiveness. It should be capable of quickly crawling sites while also ensuring thoroughness in capturing data.

2. **Scalability:** The web crawler must be scalable to handle an increasing number of web pages over time. This involves optimizing the architecture to support distributed crawling and parallel processing.

3. **Security and Compliance:** The web crawler must adhere to standard security practices and compliance requirements, such as respecting `robots.txt` files, handling user data responsibly, and complying with data protection regulations like GDPR.

4. **Error Management:** Errors and exceptions should be systematically logged and reported. The web crawler should have robust error-handling mechanisms to recover from issues without interrupting the crawling process. Additionally, it should provide detailed logs for troubleshooting and audit purposes.

## Functional Requirements Analysis

1. **Target Sites:** Specify list of domains or all internet sites. For this estimate, assume crawling all internet sites.
2. **Content Handling:** Crawl and download all data types - HTML, images, videos, documents.
3. **Dynamic Content:** Use headless browsers (e.g., Puppeteer) to handle JavaScript.
4. **Revisit Frequency:** Assume revisiting each site weekly.

## Non-Functional Requirements Analysis

1. **Performance:** Prioritize comprehensiveness over speed; target 1,000 pages per minute.
2. **Scalability:** Initial capacity to handle 10 million pages, scalable by 5% month-over-month.
3. **Security/Compliance:** Follow robots.txt, SSL/TLS, and data privacy regulations.
4. **Error Management:** Comprehensive logging system, real-time alerts on critical failures.

## Capacity Estimates

1. **User Traffic (Network I/O):**
   - Average page size: 1 MB (includes HTML, images, etc.)
   - 1,000 pages/min x 1 MB = 1,000 MB/min = 1 GB/min
   - Network throughput: 1 GB/min x 1440 min/day = 1,440 GB/day (~1.44 TB/day)

2. **Storage (Disk space):**
   - Initial data for 10 million pages: 10M pages x 1 MB/page = 10 TB
   - 5% growth/month: Account for 6 months = 10 TB x (1 + 0.05)^6 ≈ 13.4 TB

3. **Memory (RAM):**
   - Estimate for concurrent processing: Assume 10 worker nodes, each handling 100 pages/min.
   - Each worker node: 4 GB RAM (heavy processing incl. headless browsing) = 10 nodes x 4 GB = 40 GB RAM

4. **Compute (CPU):**
   - 1 page load (with JS) ≈ 0.1 CPU seconds
   - 1,000 pages/min = 1,000 x 0.1 CPU sec = 100 CPU seconds/min ~ 17 CPU min/min
   - Assuming 10 nodes: each needs ~1.7 CPU cores (round to 2 cores)
   - Total: 10 nodes x 2 cores = 20 CPU cores

5. **Networking:**
   - Bandwidth: 1 GB/min; ensure high throughput networking infrastructure.

## Configurations

- **Cluster Setup:**
  - 10 worker nodes: Each provisioned with 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, 2+ TB storage (local + distributed file system)
  - Central storage system (distributed, e.g., HDFS): 15 TB initial capacity, scalable

## Error Management & Logging

- Real-time monitoring (e.g., Prometheus), alerting (e.g., PagerDuty)
- Centralized log system (e.g., ELK stack), track all requests, responses, errors

## Security

- Ensure encrypted traffic (SSL/TLS)
- Follow robots.txt policies, compliance with data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA)

## Summary

- **Network:** 1.44 TB/day bandwidth
- **Storage:** 13.4 TB disk (scalable)
- **Memory:** 40 GB RAM
- **Compute:** 20 vCPUs
- **Security:** SSL/TLS, robots.txt, compliance monitoring
- **Error Management:** Real-time monitoring/logging system

This provides a robust, scalable, and secure setup for the web crawler, handling current and future load.
